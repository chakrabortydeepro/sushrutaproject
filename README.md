## Reading and collating manuscript transcriptions

The manuscript collations and provisional edition are handled by [Saktumiva](https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/start).

There, you can read the various transcriptions individually, or collate and compare them selectively in the manner of a critical edition.
