# MS Kathmandu NAK 5-333 (H)
## Concordance of folio images and Suśrutasaṃhitā passages in the vulgate
## By Harshal Bhatt and editing by Dominik Wujastyk

~~The folio numbers in the first column are the numbers written by the scribe on the verso of each leaf.~~  Each digital photograph has a filename like "dscn2978 fol 002.jpg". The numbers in the first column are the last digits of the name of the jpeg photo file.  In the example above, this would be "002".  Each photo contains the verso of one leaf in the upper part of the photo, followed by the recto of the next folio in the lower position.  Normally, the file name of the jpeg file contains the number of the upper image in the photo.  

For another example, file `dscn3345 fol 370.jpg` , shown below, contains the image of MS folio 370v and 371r.
