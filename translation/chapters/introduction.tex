\chapter{Introduction}

What follows is a draft translation of selected chapters of the
\emph{Compendium of Suśruta} (\emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā}).  This differs
from former translations, being based on the text that survives in the
oldest known manuscripts of the work.\footnote{See \cite{wuja-2023}
    for an introduction to the Nepalese text and \cite{wuja-2021b} for
    background on the Suśruta Project, 2021--2024.}  These old manuscripts
    are located in Nepal, so we refer to this as “the Nepalese version” of
    the work, although future research may show that this old version was
    more widely known.\footnote{For more discussion of this issue, see 
    \cite[Introduction and ch.\,2]{wuja-2023}.}  
    
The Nepalese version has been reconstructed on the basis of three
manuscripts from Kathmandu,
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \MS{Kathmandu KL 699} (siglum K),
        \item \MS{Kathmandu NAK 1-1079} (N), and
        \item \MS{Kathmandu NAK 5-333} (H).
    \end{enumerate}
The first of these MSS is the oldest, dated to
\CE~878.\footcite[15]{kleb-2021b}  It covers most of the \SS, but
lacks the \emph{Nidānasthāna} and the \emph{Śārīrasthāna} (see
Fig.\,\ref{fig:mss-1-visual-paradigm}).  The second is undated but is
datable on palaeographical grounds to the twelfth or thirteenth
centuries.\footcite[17--18]{kleb-2021b} It contains the
\emph{Sūtrasthāna} and \emph{Nidānasthāna} but breaks off shortly
afterwards.  The third manuscript, H, is the most complete, supporting
the text of the whole of the \SS. It is dated \CE~1513.\footnote{I
    follow the arguments of \citet[21--26]{kleb-2021b} on the
    interpretation of the colophon although, as he pointed out, some
    interpret the date as \CE\ 1573.} %
    The text of manuscript H follows K very closely but is probably
    not a direct apograph.\footcite{chak-2022} I conjecture that it
    was either copied from an intermediary that followed K very
    closely or from a ancestor of K.\footnote{“\ldots as neither my
        own research \ldots\ nor the study undertaken in Harimoto \ldots\
        could determine any linear connection between any of the Nepalese
        manuscripts of the SS, one may assume that [there exists] an older
        common ancestor of both of the manuscripts K and H.”

The translation follows the methods of rigorous philological care and 
modern principles of translation theory.\footnote{See 
\cite[intro.]{wuja-2003} and \cite[81--83]{wuja-2021} for an overview.}  Major 
differences in sense from the vulgate text are marked  \diff{in this 
manner}, but the differences are so pervasive and fine-grained that most have not 
been explicitly marked.

The text-historical state of the \SS\ bears many resemblances to other early 
textual transmissions in South Asia.  The situation was articulated particularly 
clearly for the case of Pāli by \citet{hinu-1978}, in the opening of his chapter, 
\begin{quote}
    \ldots we cannot go back beyond the council of Aluvihāra (Ālokavihāra) under 
    Vaṭṭagāmaṇī Abhaya (29--17 B.C.) where the Pāli canon ws written down for 
    the first time in Ceylon.  This is the very starting point of our tradition 
    handed down to us by the monks of the Mahāvihāra.  About recensions of 
    the Pāli canon different from the Mahāvihāra tradition and deviating from its 
    wording\ldots\ we scarcely have any knowledge at all.
\end{quote}
Similarly, the manuscript evidence for the \SS\ that is available
today allows us to reconstruct a version of the work after it was
consolidated into a text of five parts with a sixth or “later”
(\emph{uttara}) and somewhat different part already appended to the
first five.  The prehistory of the work before this form is
tantalizingly unknown to us.  That the work was assembled from
diverse sources and that many hands were involved is without doubt.
The oldest surviving manuscript, \MS{Kathmandu KL 699}, gives us
physical evidence for the state of the text in the ninth century.  We
little insight into the formational processes affecting the text
before that time.  But what we can see plainly is that the text was
edited pervasively after that time, being influenced especially by
the commentators Jejjaṭa, Candraṭa, Gayadāsa and Cakrapāṇidatta and
the editor Candraṭa. However, a
clear picture of how these later editorial processes took place will only be 
possible as a result of further research into a wider manuscript base.
