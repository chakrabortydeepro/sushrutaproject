    \item [1] 
    Now we shall describe the treatment of wind diseases.
    
    %\item [2] 
    weight

    \item [3] When the wind enters the stomach, one should sequentially give to
the patient, \diff{who has vomited}, the \se{yoga}{formulation} with
\se{ṣaḍdharaṇa}{six-units},  together with tepid water, for seven
nights.\footnote{The vulgate has the reading \dev{chardayitvā} which means
    "after making [him] vomit". Thus, vomiting is a part of the treatment.
    Whereas \dev{chardita} in the H manuscript is ambiguous:  vomiting may be 
    part of the treatment or a symptom of the ailment.
    
The expression “six units” refers to the six ingredients listed in the next
passage.  \Dalhana{4.4.3}{420} noted that \dev{dharaṇa} in this context 
means a
particular weight characterized as equivalent to 21 medium-sized \gls{niṣpāva}.
\citet[303]{shar-1999} proposed that that the formulation contains six
ingredients each the weight of a \emph{dharaṇa}.  See \Su{4.31.7}{508} where 
the
term \dev{dharaṇa} is defined in terms of other weights.  (In epigraphical 
Sanskrit, a \dev{dharaṇa} may be a silver or gold coin \citep[91]{sirc-1966}.)

 \AH\ \Ah{4.21.14}{723} is the same verse, mutatis mutandis, but the editor 
 noted 
 (f.n.\,6) a variant reading \dev{ṣaṭcaraṇa} in the commentary of Śrīkaṇṭha.  
 There seems to be some confusion about this expression.

Ḍalhaṇa also noted that \dev{sukhāmbu} (“pleasant water”) means “slightly 
warm water.”}

    \item [4]
    
    “Six-unit” is traditionally the formulation that is 
\gls{citraka}, \gls{indrayava}, \gls{pāṭhā},
\gls{kaṭukā}, \gls{ativiṣā}, and \gls{abhayā}. It cures serious
diseases.



    \item [5]
    When the wind has entered the \se{pakvāśa}{abdomen} one should treat it 
    with an oil purge. One should also treat it with cleansing enemas and very 
    salty foods.



    \item [6] When the wind has entered the bladder, a cleansing enema method
should be carried out. And once an inflamed wind is in the ears and the like,
a procedure that destroys wind should be done.

    \item [7]
    When the wind has reached the skin, flesh, and \diff{blood}, one should do 
    an 
    \se{abhyaṅga}{oil rub}, apply a \se{upanāha}{poultice},  
    \se{mardana}{rubbing} and \se{ālepana}{ointments}. One should also 
    perform blood-letting.\footnote{On the translation of methods of 
    medical touch, such as \dev{abhyaṅga} and \dev{saṃvāhana}, see 
    \cite[122--131]{broo-2021}.  \dev{mardana, unmardana} mean “pressing or 
    vigorous rubbing.”  The vulgate includes 
    \se{sirā}{ducts} as an added place that wind can enter.}

    \item[8]
    When the wind has got into the ligaments, joints, and bones, an expert 
    should apply  \se{sneha}{oleation},  a \se{upanāha}{poultice},
    \se{agnikarma}{cauterization}, binding, and \se{unmardana}{rubbing}.



    \item [9] When the wind is deep within the bone, then a strong physician
should insert a \se{nāḍī}{tube} into the bone, which has been split open by
\se{pāṇimantha}{manual agitation}, and suck out the wind.\footnote{The
    expression “which is split” could be construed with “wind.”  The word order
    is not obvious.  \Dalhana{4.4.9}{420} interpreted \dev{pāṇimantha} as the
    name of a particular awl and described the bone being pierced by this awl so
    that a double-headed tube can be inserted into the resulting opening.
    
    This verse is in \emph{na} vipulā metre.}
         
         
          
    % Ask Dominik Sir about the vipula types of anustup metre. Refer Ch. 106 of the Gita Darpana book of Svami Ramasukhadasa. It has many vipula variants, etc. of the anustup.        
    % My earlier comment in footnote: Also, the metre of this hemistich of the verse is not according to the \emph{anuṣṭup} metre. This gives us more reason to think that the reading \dev{asthīni} is corrupted.   

    \item[10ab]
    When the wind has reached the semen, one should perform the treatment 
    for the defects of the semen.\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa comments 
    \citep[421]{vulgate} that this treatment for the defects of the semen is 
    mentioned [earlier] as the \dev{śukraśoṇitaśuddhi}, the purification of the 
    semen and the blood. This is the \emph{Śārīrasthāna} Ch. 2, 
    \dev{śukraśoṇitaviśuddhi}.}
    
    


    \item[10cd--11] 
    
When the wind has reached the whole body, an intelligent person should
conquer it by means of immersion, \se{kuṭī}{sauna}, \se{karṣū}{trench
    sweating}, \se{prastara}{blanket sweating}, oil massage, enema, and
blood-letting.\footnote{These forms of sweating treatment are
    described in the \CS\ (\Ca{1.14.39--63}{90--92}).
    
Regarding blood-letting, \Dalhana{4.4.11}{421} commented  that because
the verse has the plural form \dev{sirāmokṣaiḥ}, five blood vessels
have to be drained of blood if the wind is not pacified by oil
massage, etc.} Or, if is located in a single limb and is stuck there,
a thoughtful physician may conquer it with
cow-horns.\footnote{\dev{śṛṅga} “cow-horns” refers to bloodletting by
    horn; see the description at \SS\ \Su{1.13.5}{55}.}
        
       
            
    \item[12] Or, if it is mingled with \se{balāsa}{phlegm}, bile, and
blood, the physician should treat it with non-hostile
remedies.\footnote{The word \dev{balāsa} is used here in the
    slightly unusual meaning “phlegm;” see \Dalhana{1.45.70,
    6.61.33}{202, 802} and \cite[553]{josi-maha}.} However, when the
    wind is inactive, he should perform blood-letting many
    times.\footnote{We read \dev{suptavāte} with witness H, but
        Ḍalhaṇa glosses \dev{supti-}, the reading of the vulgate, “it is
        wind characterized by \se{supti}{drowsiness} caused by a covering
        of blood.”}

    \item[13] And one should lick the milk cooked in \gls{pancamūlī}
together with salt and \se{āgāradhūma}{soot from the chimney},
mixed with oil and also a \se{rasa}{juice} that has the sourness of
a fruit.\footnote{The vulgate reading \dev{dihyāt} for the Nepalese 
\dev{lihyāt} changes the meaning to “one should smear.”
    
    \Dalhana{4.4.13}{421} glossed \dev{pañcamūlī} as optionally the first  or 
    the second five roots.  On this therapy, cf.\ Cakrapāṇi's commentary on 
    \Ca{1.5.3}{36} for a similar therapy.
    
    The “juice” (\dev{rasa}) was glossed by Ḍalhaṇa as specifically
being a \se{māṃsarasa}{meat broth}.   He said that the sourness
may come from fruits such as pomegranate.
    
  \dev{rasāmla} may mean a vinegar made from fruit  
\citep[70]{moni-sans}, so the expression \dev{phalāmlo rasaḥ} in the
text here may mean a vinegar made from sour fruit. Cf.\
\dev{dhānyāmla}.}
    

    \item[14--15]
    
    Alternatively, cereal soup with a good amount of ghee is a wholesome food
    that repels wind. However, “Sālvala” is  well-known  to  be a lukewarm 
    and very salty substance that is 
    the \gls{kākolī} group combined with an item that repels wind and 
    together with all the sour drugs and 
     the meat of creatures from marshes and water that have all the 
     oils.\footnote{Cf.\ \dev{sālvaṇa} “sweat from
        a poultice” in \cite[898]{josi-maha}. \AS\ \As{1.26.3}{188}
        describes a poultice called “sālvala” made with numerous
        ingredients (the commentator Indu elaborates, p.\,189).}   
    
        \item[16ab]
        
        One should always apply a bandage with that to people who are 
        ill with wind. 
   
   \item[16cd-18ab]
   
   One should tightly bind someone who is bent, afflicted by pain,
   or whose limbs are \se{numb}{stabdha}, with a 
   \se{strip of cloth}{paṭṭa} made of bark, cotton or \se{ūrṇa}{wool}.
   
   Alternatively,  one should put it into a skin sack 
   
   
 Or, after massaging the affected body part and applying the 
 \textit{śālvala}\footnote{This seems to be the correct spelling as against 
     the unclarity in the earlier verses.} poultice on it, one should insert it into a 
     sack made of the hide of a cat, mongoose, \textit{udra}\footnote{some 
         aquatic animal}, or deer.   
    
    
    
\item[18cd--19]
     
    Vomiting and an errhine done skilfully alleviate the wind that has
entered the chest, \se{trika}{between the shoulder-blades}, the
shoulders, or the nape of the neck.\footnote{On \dev{trika}, see
    \volcite{1}[387]{josi-maha}, citing \Dalhana{3.6.26}{374} “the
    junction between the shoulder-blades and the neck.”} The  wind  located in 
    the head is defeated by blood-letting and by the 
    \se{śirobasti}{application of oil to the head}.
    
    
    
     \item[20--21ab] 
     
     In that context, one should let the oil remain carefully for a
one thousand \se{mātrā}{measures}.\footnote{\Dalhana{4.2.20}{422}
    interpreted \dev{mātrā} as a measure of time, citing an
    unattributed verse defining it as the time of a blink, a snap of
    the fingers or the utterance of a single vowel. The expression
    might possibly be taken to refer to a measure of the oil's
    volume.} Only an \se{basti}{enema} can curtail the wind,  whether
    it is throughout the whole body or in just one limb.  Its
    \se{vega}{force} is like the wind.\footnote{This phrase is
        awkward. The idea here seems to be that an enema decisively stops
        the wind.  The vulgate revised this to make it more obvious:
        “only an enema can block the force of the wind, like a
        mountain.”}

Oils, perspiration, oil massage, enema, unctuous purging of the

        garments, inner rooms with sunlight, no wind flow, and a soft bed,
        taking the warmth of fire, and celibacy, etc. are to be collectively
        employed for patients with wind diseases.

    Oils, perspiration, oil massage, enema, unctuous purging of the bowels, 
    \textit{śirobasti}, oiling the head, unctuous smoke, gargling with lukewarm 
    water, \textit{nasya}, unctuous paste\q{Perhaps \textit{kalka} here could

    bed, taking the warmth of fire, and celibacy, etc. are to be collectively 
    employed for patients with wind diseases.    

    \item[27]
    One should take \textit{akṣa} quantities of unguent 
    pastes\footnote{\dev{kalka} also means an unguent paste. Refer to Apte's 
    dictionary.} of \gls{trivṛt},\footnote{In H, perhaps it should have been 
    \dev{trivṛd} instead of \dev{tṛvṛt}.} \gls{dantī}, \gls{śaṅkhinī}, 
    \gls{suvarṇṇakṣīrī}, \gls{triphalā}, and \gls{viḍaṅga}, a \gls{bilva} fruit 
    equivalent measure of \gls{tilvaka}-root and \gls{kampilya}, two 
    \textit{pātra} quantities of both 
    \textit{triphalā-}decoction\footnote{\dev{triphalārasa} is here taken to 
    mean 
    a decoction of \textit{triphalā}.} and yogurt, and one \textit{pātra} 
    measure 
    of ghee.\footnote{The exact measurements of \textit{akṣa} and 
    \textit{pātra} 
    are given in Ḍalhaṇa's commentary in \cite[422]{vulgate}.} One should mix 
    these ingredients all at once and cook the mixture properly. This (resultant) 
    is 
    \gls{tilvaka}-ghee. Unctuous purging of bowels is prescribed for treating 
    wind 
    disorders.\footnote{It should be understood here that the unctuous 
    substance 
    to be used for purging the bowels is the \gls{tilvaka}-ghee.}\\
    This procedure of making \gls{tilvaka}-ghee should also be referred for 
    making \gls{aśoka}-ghee and \gls{ramyaka}-ghee.\footnote{\dev{aśoka} 
    and \dev{ramyaka} are the Ashoka and Chinaberry respectively.}

    \item[28]
    One should collect the wooden logs of the instruments that have been used 
    for a long time for extracting oil from sesame seeds. One should then have 
    them chopped into very tiny pieces and then pound those pieces. Next, one 
    should put them in a big vessel, submerge them in water, and boil them. 
    Thereafter, one should collect the oil from the surface of the water with a 
    goblet or by hand. Thereafter, one should properly cook wind-alleviating 
    herbs with this oil that was effectively cooked.\footnote{In H, the word 
    \dev{dantapratīvāyaṃ} in the compound word 
    \dev{vātaghnauṣadhadantapratīvāyaṃ} does not appear to make sense. 
    Perhaps the syllable \dev{ya} should be \dev{pa}, thus making the word 
    \dev{pratīvāpaṃ} that refers to an admixture of substances to medicines 
    either during or after decoction. Refer to Monier-Williams's Sanskrit 
    dictionary.} This is the \textit{anutaila} (\dev{anutaila})\footnote{The 
    \dev{n} should be read \dev{ṇ}.} that is mentioned in wind disorders. It is 
    called \textit{anutaila} because it is produced from tiny oily 
    objects.\footnote{The word \dev{anu} in the compound word 
    \dev{anutailadravyebhyaḥ} should be read \dev{aṇu}.} 

    \item[29]
    Alternatively, one should burn a great amount of 
    \gls{mahāpañcamūlī}-wood on the ground for one night. When the fire gets 
    extinguished the ash should be removed. Then, the ground that is relieved 
    of the fire should be soaked with a hundred pots of oil cooked with 
    \gls{vidāri}, \gls{gandha}, and other herbs, and left in that condition for 
    one night. Thereafter, one should take all the earth that is oily\footnote{In 
    H, the word \dev{yāvan} should have been \dev{yāvān}.} in a big vessel 
    and totally cover it with water.\footnote{The reading in H, 
    \dev{kaṭāhebhyaḥ siṃcet}, does not make sense here. Thus, we have 
    accepted the vulgate reading \dev{kaṭāhe 'bhyāsiṃcet} for the translation.} 
    The oil that rises up in that vessel should be taken out with both hands and 
    kept nicely covered. Thereafter, one should properly cook that oil for as 
    long as possible\footnote{The phrase "\dev{yāvatā kālena śaknuyāt 
    paktum}" appears as a part of a new sentence in H. But, we should take it 
    to be a part of the earlier sentence for it to make proper sense.} with one 
    thousand parts of each of the following---a decoction of wind-alleviating 
    herbs, meat soup, milk, and \textit{kāñjika}\footnote{Ḍalhaṇa comments 
    \citep[423]{vulgate} that the word \dev{amla} here means \dev{kāñjika} 
    which is the water drained after boiling rice and is a little fermented. Refer 
    Monier Willams's Sanskrit Dictionary.}---and thus prepare the 
    \textit{sahasra-pāka} (that which is cooked with thousands). The admixture 
    added to the oil contains the \textit{hemavata} herbs\footnote{The word 
    should be \dev{haimavatāḥ} as in the vulgate. It means "the herbs of the 
    snowy mountains". Ḍalhaṇa comments \citep[423]{vulgate} that 
    \dev{haimavatāḥ} refers to the herbs that grow in the northern region.}, 
    herbs of the southern region, \gls{aśvagandhā}, and other wind-alleviating 
    herbs.\\
    While the oil is being cooked, conchshells should be blown loudly, umbrellas 
    should be held, huge drums should be resounded, and whisk fans should be 
    waved.\footnote{These activities are a symbolic way of showing 
    reverence.} Thereafter, the perfectly cooked oil should be poured into a 
    golden or silver pot and stored. This \textit{sahasra-pāka} is the oil 
    possessing undiminishing potency and is fit for kings.\\
    Thus, that which is cooked with a thousand parts is called 
    \textit{sahasra-pāka}.

    \item[30]
    One should collect fresh leaves of \gls{gandharvahasta}, \gls{aṭa}, 
    \gls{ruṣkaka}, \gls{muṣkaka}, \gls{naktamāla}, \gls{pūtikā}, and 
    \gls{citraka}.\footnote{In H, the ending \dev{nām} should be \dev{ṇām} 
    due to sandhi.} These leaves should be completely pounded along with salt 
    in a mortar. This mixture should be put in a pot filled with 
    oil\footnote{\dev{snehaghaṭa} can also mean a pot filled with ghee}. It 
    (pot) should be smeared\footnote{The H or vulgate do not specify with 
    words that it is the pot to be smeared. But, it is to be understood.} with 
    cow-dung. Thereafter, the pot should be heated.\footnote{The word 
    \dev{dāhayet} usually refers to burning, but sometimes it can refer to 
    heating.} This (resultant) is the \textit{patra-lavaṇa} (leaf-salt) that is 
    mentioned in wind disorders. 

    \item[31]
    In the same way, one should pound the stalks of \gls{snuhā}\q{Euphorbia 
    Antiquorum (Antique spurge)} and eggplants smeared with salt and fill a pot 
    with it.\footnote{In H, there should be a \textit{visarga} after 
    \dev{lavaṇā}.} In that pot, one should add ghee, oil, fat, and marrow. Then, 
    one should smear it\footnote{As earlier, the pot should be smeared with 
    cow-dung.} and heat it as earlier. This (resultant) is the 
    \textit{sneha-lavaṇa} (fat-salt) that is mentioned in wind disorders.

    \item[32]
    One should collect the fresh fruits, roots, leaves, and branches of all the 
    twenty [herbs]: \gls{gaṇḍīra}, \gls{palāśa}, \gls{kuṭaja}, \gls{bilva}, 
    \gls{arka}, \gls{snuhā}, \gls{pāmārga}, \gls{pāṭalī}, \gls{pāribhadraka}, 
    \gls{nādeyī}, \gls{kṛṣṇagandhā}, \gls{nīpa}, \gls{nirdahī}, \gls{ānyāṭa}, 
    \gls{rūṣaka}, \gls{naktamāla}, \gls{pūtīka}, \gls{bṛhatī}, \gls{kaṇṭakārikā}, 
    \gls{bhallātaka}, \gls{aśoka}, \gls{vaijayantī}. One should then mix them 
    with salt and heat them as earlier.\footnote{It is to be understood that all 
    these fresh branches, leaves, fruits, and roots of the herbs should be 
    completely pounded together with salt. The mixture should then be put into 
    a pot filled with oil or ghee. The pot should be smeared with cow-dung and 
    then heated.} The oil on top should be poured out completely with the salty 
    mixture intact [at the bottom]. This mixture should be cooked thoroughly. 
    The admixture added to it consists of \gls{pippalī}, etc. This (resultant) is 
    the salt called \textit{kalyāṇaka} that is mentioned in wind disorders and in 
    meals and drinks for the patients troubled by \textit{plīhāgnisaṃga}, 
    indigestion, loss of appetite, and piles.


    Thus ends the fourth chapter on the treatment of wind diseases.
