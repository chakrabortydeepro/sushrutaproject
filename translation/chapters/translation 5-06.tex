    \item[1] Now I shall explain the \se{kalpa}{formal procedure}
for drumming.
    
    \item[3] 
     One should take the ash of the following items, mix it with 
     cows' urine and an alkaline compound, take an extract and cook 
     it thoroughly:
     % deep  breath ...
     \gls{dhava},
     \gls{aśvakarṇa},
     \gls{tiniśa}, 
     \gls{picumarda}, 
     \gls{pāṭalī}, 
     \gls{pāribhadraka},\footnote{\label{drum-detox}The ingredients to this point
         are similar to the water-detoxifier described in \SS\ \Su{5.3.9}{568}, 
         p.\,\pageref{water-detox} above.}
     \gls{udumbara}, 
     \gls{karaghāṭaka}, 
     \gls{arjuna},
     \gls{sarjja}, 
     \gls{kapītana}, 
     \gls{śleṣmātakā}, 
     \gls{aṅkoṭha},
     \gls{kuṭaja},
     \gls{śamī}, 
     \gls{kapittha},
     \gls{aśmantaka},
     \gls{arka},
     \gls{ciribilva}, 
     \gls{mahāvṛkṣa}, 
     \gls{arala}, 
     \gls{madhuka},
     \gls{madhukaśigru}, 
     \gls{śāka},
     \gls{gojī}, 
     \gls{bhūrja}, 
     \gls{tilvaka},
     \gls{ikṣuraka},
     \gls{gopaghoṇṭā}, 
     and
     \gls{arimeda}.
     
One should add to this the powder of the following items, together
with an equal quantity of powdered metals: \gls{pippalī},
\gls{pippalīmūla}, \gls{taṇḍulīyaka}, \gls{varāṅga}, \gls{coraka},
\gls{mañjiṣṭhā}, \gls{karañjikā}, \gls{hastipippalī}, \gls{viḍaṅga},
soot\sse{gṛhadhūma}{soot}, \gls{ananta}, soma,\q{Roots page
    number.}\footnote{The literature on the identification of Soma is
    large \citep[passim]{wuja-2003}. To the cited literature, the useful
    historical discussion by \citet[449--455]{gvdb} gives special
    attention to the āyurvedic literature.} \gls{sarala}, \gls{bāhlīka},
    \gls{kuśa}, \gls{āmra}, \gls{sarṣapa}, \gls{varuṇa}, \gls{plakṣa},
    \gls{nicula}, \gls{vardhamāna}, \gls{vañjula}, \gls{putraśreṇī},
    \gls{saptaparṇa}, \gls{ṭuṇṭuka}, \gls{elavāluka},
    \gls{nāgadantī},\footnote{\Dalhana{5.6.3}{580} glossed
        \dev{nāgadantī} as a type of \dev{indravāruṇī} (\gls{indravāruṇī}),
        but he noted that Jejjaṭa had thought it was \dev{dantī}
        (\gls{dantī}).} \gls{ativiṣā}, \gls{bhadradāru}, \gls{marica},
        \gls{kuṣṭha}, and \gls{vacā}.\footnote{\Dalhana{5.6.3}{580} noted
            that Gayadāsa omitted several of the above ingredients, keeping
            thirty.}  Once it has been brought to the boil with the alkali, one
            should take it down and place it in a iron
            pot.\footnote{\label{kṣārapāka2}\Dalhana{5.6.3}{580} explained that
                the above substances, from pepper onwards, should be placed in liquid
                alkali and then cooked until they are neither too runny nor too
                viscous (a phrase he copied from \Su{1.11.11}{47}).  The preparation
                of \dev{pāka} is particularly common in the \SS\ and the \AH.  Cf.\
                the very similar ingredients and procedure in the chapter on alkali
                preparations, \SS\ \Su{1.11.11}{46--47}, p.\,\pageref{kṣārapāka}
                above.}
                
\item[4]    

One should smear this onto a drum as well as onto flags and
\diff{blankets}.\footnote{The vulgate has \dev{toraṇa} “gateways”
    instead of \dev{āstaraṇa} “blankets.”} One is released from all
    poisons as a result of seeing and hearing these.    

\item[5--7]

This is called “The Caustic Antidote.” It should be given in cases of
\se{śarkarā}{small urinary calculi}, \se{aśmarī}{urinary calculus},
hemorrhoids, \se{vātagulma}{wind-swelling}, cough,
\se{śūla}{abdominal gripes} and \se{udara}{swollen belly}.  It should
be given for indigestion, \se{grahaṇīdoṣa}{humours of the abdomen}
and severe \se{bhaktadveṣa}{aversion to food}, in swelling,
\se{sarvasara}{mouth ulcer}, and persistent
\se{śvāsa}{asthma}.\footnote{\dev{aśmarī} and \dev{śarkarā} are
    described in \SS\ \Su{2.3}{276--280}, the latter being smaller and
    more easily expelled (\Su{2.3.13cd--14}{279};  cf.\
    \volcite{1}[67--68, 808--809]{josi-maha}). The commentators
    Cakrapāṇidatta and Ḍalhaṇa discussed the lack of a firm distinction
    between these categories.} % give
    %    references for \dev{śarkarā} as sugar \citep[see
    %    also][5-7--508]{meul-1974} but also as an ailment that is a
    %    subdivision of \dev{aśmarī}.}
    This is to be employed in all cases where someone is suffering as
    a result of any poison.  Thus, it is the antidote that is  the
    \se{sarpāṅkuśa}{Snakes' Controlling Hook} even for the snakes
    whose leader is Takṣaka.\footnote{\dev{takṣaka} is an ancient
        name for a Nāga, mentioned in the \emph{Kauśikasūtra} \citep[28.1
        \emph{et passim},][78]{bloo-1890}. Takṣaka is mentioned briefly
        in the \emph{Rāmāyaṇa} \citep[292, n.\,13]{poll-1991} and more in
        later works.}\textsuperscript{, }\footnote{There follow four verses in the 
        vulgate,
            8--11, that are not present in the Nepalese version.  These list
            ingredients that form a ghee called \se{kalyāṇaka}{The Salutary}.
            This ghee recipe with the same name is also present in the
            \emph{Uttaratantra} at \Su{6.39.229--232}{689}, where it is a
            treatment for mostly similar ailments: chronic fever, asthma,
            cough, swelling, madness and a \se{gara}{toxic potion} (defined
            at \Su{5.8.24cd--25ab}{587} as something manufactured,
            \dev{kṛtrima}).  However, in the Nepalese version at 6.39.232,
            the vulgate statement of this name “\dev{etatkalyāṇakaṃ nāma
            sarpirmāṅgalyamuttamam}” is not present. So, in the Nepalese
            version, \se{kalyāṇaka}{The Salutary} is not named. The same
            named ghee also appears in the \CS\ at \Ca{6.9.42}{471}, where it
            is a treatment for \se{unmāda}{madness} and other ailments; it is
            possible that this is a case where a text from the \CS\ was added
            to the \SS\ after the Nepalese version`.}
