\chapter{Kalpasthāna 6: Rats, Scorpions and Spiders}
\label{mūṣikā}


\section{Introduction}

A notable macro-difference between the vulgate and the Nepalese
versions of the \SS\ is that this chapter and the next are reversed
in the vulgate.  In the Nepalese version, this is chapter six and the
chapter on antitoxic drumming is chapter seven.\footnote{See
    p.\,\pageref{kalpa-chapter-sequence} above.}

\subsection{Mouse or Rat?}

In 2004, Umberto Eco published a characteristically subtle and
enlightening book about translation entitled \emph{Mouse or
    Rat?}.\footcite{eco-2004} The title alluded to Eco's discussion of the
example of translating words for mice and rats across several
European languages that do not always distinguish these animals from
each other, or confuse them in other ways.  In Sanskrit too,
\emph{mūṣikā}, the subject and title of this chapter, does not
distinguish between mouse and rat.  The same is true for MIA and NIA
derivatives.\footcite[\#10258]{CDIAL}  It is hard to know quite how
to translate the term since “rodent” is too broad a term.  In what
follows, I have chosen “rat” for \emph{mūṣikā} in order to produce a
working translation of a text about an animal that is viewed as toxic
and threatening.  ``Mouse'' does not have quite these connotations
for a contemporary English speaker.\footnote{\citeauthor{bhis-1907}
    made the same choice \pvolcite{2}[728--736]{bhis-1907}.}

The rodents that may be described as mice or rats in contemporary
South Asia and that are especially associated with the spread of
disease include the 
house or black rat (\emph{Rattus rattus}, L.), 
the brown rat (\emph{R.\ norvegicus}, Berkenhout), the 
house mouse (\emph{Mus musculus}, L.) and 
bandicoots (\emph{Bandicota}).\footcite[194]{bia} 
Also present in SA are the 
Indian desert gerbille (\emph{Meriones hurrianae}, Jerdon), 
the Indian gerbille (\emph{Tatera indica}, Hardwicke), 
the spiny field mouse (\emph{Mus platythrix}, Bennett),
the Indian field mouse (\emph{M. booduga}, Gray), 
the Metad (\emph{Millardia meltada}, Gray),
the Indian bush rat (\emph{Golunda ellioti}, Gray), 
the longtailed tree mouse (\emph{Vandeleuria oleracea}, Bennett), 
Royle's vole (\emph{Aticola roylei}, Gray), 
the Indian mole-rat (\emph{Bandicota bengalensis}, Gray \& 
Hardwicke),\footnote{“Recent studies\ldots show that the mole-rat forms 
98\% of the total rodent population of Calcutta,” \cite[206]{bia}.} 
the bandicoot rat (\emph{B. indica}, Bechstein), 
the shorttailed bandicoot (\emph{Nesokia indica}, Gray \& Hardwicke),
the whitetailed wood rat (\emph{Madromys blanfordi}, Thomas), 
the bay bamboo rat (\emph{Cannomys badius}, Hodgson),
and other similar rodents.\footcite[ill.\ plates \,45, 46 \emph{et passim}]{bia}
However, plausibly matching these creatures to the Sanskrit names listed in 
this chapter is hard to impossible.\footnote{Mouse-words that we do not see 
in this chapter include the \emph{kirika, giri, girikā} 
group \pvolcite{1}[353, 488, 566]{EWA}.}


\subsection{Literature}

A brief survey of this chapter's contents and reference to the
limited existing research on it to 2002 was provided by
Meulenbeld.\footnote{\volcite{IA}[295--296]{meul-hist}. In addition
    to the translations mentioned by \tvolcite{IB}[314--315]{meul-hist},
    a translation of this chapter was included in
    \volcite{3}[67--77]{shar-1999}. \citet{sekh-2023} omitted mention of
    this type of poisoning, although he discussed rabies, a subsection of
    this chapter.}
    

A rich description of Indian rodents is available in \cite[ch.\,13,
esp.\,205--215]{bia}, including several useful illustration. 
Unfortunately, \citeauthor{bia} rarely gave Indian-language
names.

Now I shall explain the \se{kalpa}{procedure} relating to 
\se{mūṣikā}{rats}.\footnote{The word \dev{mūṣikā} does not distinguish 
between rats and mice.  See Introduction above.}
    
    \item[3] 
    
    Learn concisely about aforementioned eighteen kinds of rats that have 
    poison in their semen, according to their names, characteristics and the 
    herbal treatments.\footnote{Rats with poisonous semen were mentioned 
    in \Su{5.3.5}{5.6.7} (see p.\,\pageref{sukravisa} above).}
