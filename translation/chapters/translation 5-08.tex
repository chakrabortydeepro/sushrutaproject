\chapter{Kalpasthāna 8: Poisonous insects}

\section{Introduction} 

This is the last chapter of the \emph{Kalpasthāna}.  Since the
chapter-colophons of the Nepalese manuscripts commonly end with the
statement, “here ends the \SS\ together with the Uttaratantra,” we can
presume that an older version of the \SS, sans Uttaratantra, ended
with the present chapter.  Added to this, the beginning of the next
section of the work, the Uttaratantra, reads,
\begin{quote}
    It being declared in the preceding 120
chapters, from here on, in the latter section, I shall explain the
meanings in detail, fully.\footnote{Note that this is not the reading
    of the vulgate, which says that the Uttaratantra will explain
    everything that was \emph{not} completely explained before.}  Now, I
    shall explain the treatise called “the latter” where diseases
    in their diversity are fully revealed.
    \end{quote}
It is often the case with evolving works that new chapters are added
at the start or, especially, at the end of a work.  This has been true
since the \emph{Ṛgveda}.  The Kalpasthāna has a different character
from the rest of the \SS, for example eschewing theoretical
considerations in many situations.  It may therefore itself have once
been an addition to an even earlier medical work consisting of four main
divisions.

    
\subsection{Insect names}

It is more than usually difficult to equate the Sanskrit names of
insects with contemporary creatures.  In fact, it is mostly impossible. This is 
partly, at least,
because historical entomology is non-existent as a discipline.
Furthermore, entomology as a science in South Asia is dramatically
undeveloped when compared, for example, with
botany.\footnote{\citet{desm-1992} devoted a book of 368 pages to the
    early history of Indian botany; \citet[338--345]{dove-1922} described
    the history of Indian entomology in seven pages.}  There are few
    general surveys of insects in India and virtually none that record
    historical names or literary references.  In the twelfth century,
    Ḍalhaṇa made the following remark about the commentators who lived
    before his time:
\begin{quote}
These different types of insects are not described by commentators
like Suvīra, Nandin,Varāha, Jejjjaṭa and Gayadāsa, so they have to be
identified from the people of different
localities.\footnote{\Dalhana{5.8.4}{586}: \dev{ete kīṭakabhedā
    nānādeśīyalokādavagantavyāḥ, yataḥ
    suvīranandivarāhajejjaṭagayadāsādibhiḥ ṭīkākārairna vyākhyātāḥ}.
    (Varāha is called Vārāha by \Dalhana{2.13.3}{318}.) Cf.\
    \tvolcite{IA}[387--388]{meul-hist} on Suvīra and \emph{mutatis
mutandis} on
    the other commentators}
\end{quote}
Thus, even pre-modern Sanskrit authors were not expert regarding the
identities of the insects discussed in the
\SS.\footnote{\cite{moni-sans} includes 191 insect names, almost none
    of which are identified.}  
    
In general the names listed in passages 5--14 are the  least
recognizable.  Most seem never to appear elsewhere in Sanskrit
literature or even elsewhere in the \SS.  The names mentioned from
passages 25 onwards are mostly recognizable and do appear elsewhere
Sanskrit literature.\footcite[E.g.,][]{mitr-2005} This chapter
therefore gives the appearance of having two distinct parts.  First,
there is a taxonomy arranged according to humoral characteristics,
containing otherwise unknown insect names. Second follows a
concatenated treatise with more recognizable ordinary-language
nomenclature coupled with creature-by-creature nosology and therapy.

\subsection{Literature} A brief survey of this chapter's contents and
a detailed assessment of the existing research on it to 2002 was
provided by Meulenbeld.\footcite[IA, 296--299]{meul-hist} 

The early history of entomology in India was fragmented until the
study of \citet{maxw-1909} who provided a comprehensive and well
illustrated reference compendium. \citet{dove-1922} gave an overview
of the early years of the field, though he admitted that, “I have not
the linguistic attainments to discuss the mention of various insects
in ancient Sanskrit works.”   Entomological studies focussed on south
India include those of \citet{bain-1914} and \citet{rama-1963}.
\tvolcite{IB}[402]{meul-hist} provided short bibliographies on Indian
scorpions (note 214) and on spiders (note 222). Some insects were
included by \citet{ball-1888} in his study of the Indian flora and fauna
known to classical Greek authors. \citet{kaur-2018} provided a unique
but very brief historical sketch of some arthropod references in
Sanskrit literature.

 And now I shall explain the \se{kalpa}{procedure} about 
 insects\sse{kīṭa}{insect}.
 

\subsection{Taxonomy of insects}

%\item[3--17ab] 

\item [3] 

Insects originate from snakes' semen, feces, urine, the rot of corpses,
and eggs.\footnote{\tvolcite{3}[78]{shar-1999} omitted “snakes'\,” making it 
sound as if insects are just born of any semen, etc.}  Their
\sse{prakṛti}{character}characters are traditionally divided
into \diff{three}: wind, fire, and water.

\item[4]

Yet others hold the opinion that they are connected with the
\sse{prakṛti}{character}characters of all of the humours. And those
insects are also very fierce and all of them are divided into four
groups.\footnote{The insects named in the following lists are all
    unidentifiable at the present time.  The English translations are
    based mostly on the etymologies of the Sanskrit names.  Future
    ethno-linguistic studies of insect-names in South Asia may solve some
    cases.}

    The
        vulgate text has another half-verse here listing two more names,
        \dev{śatabāhu} “hundred-arm” and \dev{raktarāji} “red-stripe.” It does
        not include the Nepalese version's \dev{alpavāca} “little voice."}

        \end{enumerate}

        \item \Gls{agnikīṭa},
       \end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

These are the twelve terrible ones that are born of all three humours.
The knowledge about the stages of \se{vega}{toxic shock} of those
bitten by one of these is the same as with snakes.\footnote{Two verses
