\chapter{Kalpasthāna 8: Poisonous insects}

\section{Introduction} 

This is the last chapter of the \emph{Kalpasthāna}.  Since the
chapter-colophons of the Nepalese manuscripts of the whole
\emph{Suśrutasaṃhitā} commonly end with the statement, “here ends the
\SS\ together with the \emph{Uttaratantra},” we can presume that an older
version of the \SS, sans \emph{Uttaratantra}, ended with the present chapter.
Added to this, the beginning of the next section of the work, the
\emph{Uttaratantra}, reads,
\begin{quote}
It being declared in the preceding 120
chapters, from here on, in the latter section, I shall explain the
meanings in detail, fully.\footnote{Note that this is not the reading
    of the vulgate, which says that the \emph{Uttaratantra} will explain
    everything that was \emph{not} completely explained before.}  Now, I
    shall explain the treatise called “the latter” where diseases
    in their diversity are fully revealed.
    \end{quote}
It is often the case with evolving works that new chapters are added
at the start or, especially, at the end of a work.  This has been true
since the \emph{Ṛgveda}.  The \emph{Kalpasthāna} has a different character
from the rest of the \SS, for example eschewing theoretical
considerations in many situations.  It may therefore itself have once
been an addition to an even earlier medical work consisting of four main
divisions.

\subsection{Insect names}

It is more than usually difficult to equate the Sanskrit names of
insects with contemporary creatures.  In fact, it is mostly
impossible. This is partly, at least, because historical entomology is
non-existent as a discipline. Furthermore, entomology as a science in
South Asia is dramatically undeveloped when compared, for example,
with botany.\footnote{\citet{desm-1992} devoted a book of 368 pages to
    the early history of Indian botany; \citet[338--345]{dove-1922}
    described the history of Indian entomology in seven pages.}  There are
few general surveys of insects in India and virtually none that record
historical names or literary references.  In the twelfth century,
Ḍalhaṇa made the following remark about the commentators who lived
before his time:
\begin{quote}
These different types of insects are not described by commentators
like Suvīra, Nandin,Varāha, Jejjjaṭa and Gayadāsa, so they have to be
identified from the people of different
localities.\footnote{\Dalhana{5.8.4}{586}: \dev{ete kīṭakabhedā
    nānādeśīyalokādavagantavyāḥ, yataḥ
    suvīranandivarāhajejjaṭagayadāsādibhiḥ ṭīkākārairna vyākhyātāḥ}.
    (Varāha is called Vārāha by \Dalhana{2.13.3}{318}.) Cf.\
    \tvolcite{IA}[387--388]{meul-hist} on Suvīra and \emph{mutatis
mutandis} on
    the other commentators}
\end{quote}
Thus, even pre-modern Sanskrit authors were not expert regarding the
identities of the insects discussed in the
\SS.\footnote{\cite{moni-sans} includes 191 insect names, almost none
    of which are identified.}  
    
In general the names listed in passages 5--14 are the  least
recognizable.  Most seem never to appear elsewhere in Sanskrit
literature or even elsewhere in the \SS.  The names mentioned from
passages 25 onwards are mostly recognizable and do appear elsewhere
Sanskrit literature.\footcite[E.g.,][]{mitr-2005} This chapter
therefore gives the appearance of having two distinct parts.  First,
there is a taxonomy arranged according to humoral characteristics,
containing otherwise unknown insect names. Second follows a
concatenated treatise with more recognizable ordinary-language
nomenclature coupled with creature-by-creature nosology and therapy.

\subsection{Literature} A brief survey of this chapter's contents and
a detailed assessment of the existing research on it to 2002 was
provided by Meulenbeld.\footcite[IA, 296--299]{meul-hist} 

The early history of entomology in India was fragmented until the
study of \citet{maxw-1909} who provided a comprehensive and well
illustrated reference compendium. \citet{dove-1922} gave an overview
of the early years of the field, though he admitted that, “I have not
the linguistic attainments to discuss the mention of various insects
in ancient Sanskrit works.”   Entomological studies focussed on south
India include those of \citet{bain-1914} and \citet{rama-1963}.
\tvolcite{IB}[402]{meul-hist} provided short bibliographies on Indian
scorpions (note 214) and on spiders (note 222). Some insects were
included by \citet{ball-1888} in his study of the Indian flora and fauna
known to classical Greek authors. \citet{kaur-2018} provided a unique
but very brief historical sketch of some arthropod references in
Sanskrit literature.

 And now I shall explain the \se{kalpa}{procedure} about 
 insects\sse{kīṭa}{insect}.
 

\subsection{Taxonomy of insects}

%\item[3--17ab] 

\item [3] 

Insects originate from snakes' semen, feces, urine, the rot of corpses,
and eggs.\footnote{\tvolcite{3}[78]{shar-1999} omitted “snakes'\,” making it 
sound as if insects are just born of any semen, etc.}  Their
\sse{prakṛti}{character}characters are traditionally divided
into \diff{three}: wind, fire, and water.

\item[4]

Yet others hold the opinion that they are connected with the
\sse{prakṛti}{character}characters of all of the humours. And those
insects are also very fierce and all of them are divided into four
groups.\footnote{The insects named in the following lists are all
    unidentifiable at the present time.  The English translations are
    based mostly on the etymologies of the Sanskrit names.  Future
    ethno-linguistic studies of insect-names in South Asia may solve some
    cases.}

        \dev{śatabāhu} “hundred-arm” and \dev{raktarāji} “red-stripe.” It does
        not include the Nepalese version's \dev{alpavāca} “little voice."}

       \end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

\item[17ab]

The fire insects are terrible.  There are twelve, born of the three
humours.

\subsection{Symptoms}

\item[17cd] 

For someone bitten by one of these, the information about the stages
of \se{vega}{toxic shock} is the same as with snakes.\footnote{Two
    verses appear at this point in the vulgate that are not in the
    Nepalese version.  They introduce a categorization of insect poisons
    into severe versus mild, a scheme that the Nepalese version does not
    reference.\label{gradation}}

\item[20--21] 

The following are found in the area of a bite, or in a body
\se{ākula}{overflowing} with poison: an eruption of blisters, swelling,
lumps and circles, \se{dardru}{ringworm},\footnote{More usually
    \dev{dadru}, a skin disease like \dev{kuṣṭha}, i.e., leprosy or
    vitiligo, caused by an excess of bile and phlegm
    \citep[390]{josi-maha}, although the form \dev{dardru} is mentioned in
    the \emph{Uṇādisūtra} commentary by Śvetavanavāsin (fl.\,tenth to
    fifteenth century), “\dev{dardrūḥ kuṣṭhabhedaḥ}” (I.88). Translated
    here as “ringworm” because that is prominent amongst the NIA usages of
    the lexeme and derivatives
    \pvolcite{1}[\#6142]{CDIAL}.}\sse{dadru}{ringworm} % Ca.1.3.7
\se{karṇikā}{small ear-like growths}, \se{visarpa}{spreading rashes},
and \se{kiṭibha}{dark, rough patches of skin}.\footnote{These symptoms
    are the same as those listed at \Su{5.7.8}{582} as being caused by rat
    poisoning, and similar to the list at \Su{1.11.7}{46}.  See footnote
    \ref{karṇika}, p.\,\pageref{karṇika}.
    
    Again, the vulgate has three and a half added verses.  They describe how to 
    recognize severe poisoning and mild poisoning, developing the idea of graded 
    degrees mentioned in note \ref{gradation} above.}

\subsection{Taxonomy according to symptoms and prognosis}

\item[25cd] 

From here onwards he will explain each individual class of insects
separately.\footnote{On \dev{vakṣyate} “he will explain” see note to
    the edition.}

\item[26]

These four \se{kaṇabha}{hornets} that cause sharp pain are described
in general terms according to the symptoms of the person bitten, and
according to whether they are treatable or non-treatable:\footnote{The
    translation “hornet” is adopted in light of the Tamil \emph{kaṭampai}
    and cognates described by \cite[\#1117]{DED}.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \se{trikaṇṭaka}{Triple-sting}, \item
\se{kunī}{Hopper},\footnote{The translation “hopper” gestures,
    with no real basis, to the Tamil word \emph{kuṉi} and cognates,
    meaning “dance, jump, leap” \cite[\#1863]{DED}. For \dev{kunī},
    the vulgate has the equally unknown term \dev{kariṇī}.} \item
    \se{hastikakṣya}{Lion}, and \item \se{aparājita}{Undefeated}.
\end{itemize}

\item[27]

Someone \se{daṣṭa}{stung} by one of these experiences heaviness of the limbs 
and pain in the 
body, \diff{a flow of saliva and a severe rupture of the legs}.\footnote{The 
Nepalese and vulgate texts diverge noticeably at this point.  This passage, 27, is in 
verse in the Nepalese version, but in prose in the vulgate.  At this 
point, the Nepalese text continues with further passages in verse, while 
the vulgate has a series of prose passages (5.8.28--37) and verse passages that are 
similar but not identical to the Nepalese version (39--41).  In several cases, 
the Nepalese version's verses are in irregular forms of śloka (\emph{vipulā}), 
which may have prompted a redactor to recast the text as prose.}


\item[28a, 28b]

There are traditionally five \glspl{godheraka}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \se{pratisūrya}{Counter-sun},
    \item \se{piṅgabhāsa}{Yellow-shine},
    \item \se{bahuvarṇa}{Multicolour},
    \item \se{mahāśiras}{Bighead},
    \item \se{nirupama}{Peerless}.
\end{itemize}
The information about the toxic pulses that affect someone bitten by
one of these is the same as for snakes.  There are pains of
various kinds and extremely sore lumps.\footnote{The Nepalese
    reading of this passage, which differs significantly from the vulgate,
    was known to Ḍalhaṇa, who quoted it almost exactly as the reading "of
    some" \citep[587]{vulgate}.  Ḍalhaṇa also quoted the description of
    the iguana (\dev{Godheraka}) from \dev{tantrāntara} “another book,”
    i.e., the \CS\ (\Ca{6.23.134}{577} with minor differences).}

\item[29a, 29b]

These are the six \glspl{gṛhagolikā}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \se{śvetā}{White},
    \item \se{kṛṣṇā}{Black},
    \item \se{kṛṣṇarājī}{Black-striped},
    \item \se{raktā}{Crimson and Crimson-ringed},
    \item \se{sarvaśvetā}{All-white},
    \item \se{sarṣapikā}{Mustard}.
