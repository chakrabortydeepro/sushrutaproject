    \item[1]  And now we shall explain the chapter on the prevention of fever.
    
    % Thursday, Oct 20, 2022
    
    \item[2]
    
    \item[3.1]  And now, O Suśruta.\q{Footnote here about who is speaking to 
    whom.}
    
    \item[3--5ab]  Suśruta and the other disciples asked the enthroned
god who, in a previous incarnation, had extracted ambrosia from the
middle of the ocean of milk from which the three and thirty gods
attained immortality. O best of physicians! Complications
relating to the wounds of those who are wounded have been explained.  So
now, tell us in brief and at length.\footnote{This
    suggests that this chapter followed a chapter on wounds.  Yet it
    follows the chapter on diseases of the female reproductive tract
    (\emph{yonivyāpat}), or in MS, the chapter on demons
    (\emph{grahotpatti}).  This suggests that this chapter was once
    located at another place in the text, perhaps after
    \Su{1.22}{107--110} “questions about wound discharges
    (\emph{vraṇāsrāva})”. XXX}
    
    % Friday, Oct 21, 2022 and Oct 4 2023
    
    \item[5cd] The wound afflicted by the complication is difficult to treat.
    
    \item[6] Complications of the wounded person are supposed to be the most
    difficult to treat because of the waste of the remaining body tissues
    and the diminished strength of muscle.
    
    \item[7ab] Thus, O best of speakers, please describe all the complications.
    
    \item[8] After hearing their statement, the best of the physicians spoke- in
    the beginning, I will explain fever, which is remembered as the king of
    diseases.
    
%    % Saturday, Oct 22
    
    \item[9] It has arisen from the blazing anger of Rudra and distressing all the
    living beings. It is described by these and those names of many living
    beings.
    
    \item[10] Undoubtedly, the fever occurs here at the beginning of birth and
    death. Thus fever is stated as the king of all diseases.
    
 %   % Sunday, Oct 23
    
    \item[11ab] No one except the gods and human beings tolerate it.
    
    \item[11cd]  
    
    \item[12]  
    
    \item[13ab]  
    
    \item[13cd] There are sweat obstruction, increased temperature, and 
excessive
    pain all over the parts of body.
    
    % Monday, Oct 24
    
    \item[14ab] Simultaneously here, the disease is instructed to be fever.
    
   \item[14cd]  
    
    \item[15] Even though the fever has arisen from different causes, it is
    prescribed in eight kinds. In those who eat unwholesome food, the humors
    are aggravated.
    
    \item[16ab] They permeate the body entirely and indeed cause to bring 
fever.
    
   \item[16cd]  
    
   \item[17]  
    
   \item[18]  
    
    \item[19cd] Even by the wrongly performed and unctuousness etc., and by 
the
    actions of people.
    
    \item[20] From the various kinds of hindrances, from the emergence of
    diseases, excessive exercise, decay, indigestion, evenness from poison,
    and the alteration of balance.
    
    % Tuesday, Oct 25
    
    \item[21] From the smell of poisonous flowers, aggravation from the eclipse 
of
    stars, curses, magical spells, and suspicion of seizers.
    
    \item[22] Abnormal delivery in women, using unwholesome things during
    childbirth, and in the first breastfeeding. The fever is aggravated by
    the humor. (19--22)
    
    \item[23--24]  These humors, agitated and bewildered in many ways going in 
the
    wrong direction, throw the internal digestive fire out that moves
    outside. The inner digestive fire prevents the passage of sweat, raising
    the temperature of the person's body. The body becomes very hot and does
    not sweat all over.
    
    % Thursday, Oct 27
    
    \item[25]  Exhaustion, discontent, paleness, bad taste, the flow of tears from
    eyes, repeated desire and dislike in cold, air, sun-heat, etc.
    
    \item[26]  Yawning, pain in limbs, heaviness, hair loss, tastelessness, and
    darkness, the suffering person becomes unhappy and cold then the fever
    will arise.
    
    % Friday, Oct 28
    
    \item[27]  Generally, and, especially, excessive yawning due to breeze, 
burning
    in the eyes, and no appetite for food are observed in cases of wind,
    bile, and phlegm, respectively.
    
    % Saturday, Oct 29
    
    \item[28]  In the fever generated by aggravation of all humors, all the
    symptoms are mixed up. In the case of either of two, the fever is
    mingled with and the involvement of two humors in disease causation is
    wisely united.
    
    ( I am not happy with this translation and will have to rework it.)
    
    \item[29]  Trembling, inconstant paroxysm, dryness of the throat and lips, 
loss
    of sleep, decline, collapse, and roughness of the body parts.
    
    % Sunday, Oct 30
    
    \item[30]  Headache, pain in the body, pain in speech organs, repugnance, 
the
    thickness of the stomach, soothing pain, flatulence, and yawning are the
    symptoms of fever originating from the wind.
    
    \item[31]  Intense attack, rough diarrhea, and internal solid heat, little
    sleep and vomiting, inflammation in the throat, lips, mouth appear.
    
    % Monday, Oct 31
    
    \item[32]  Babbling, pungent mouth, fainting, heat, intoxication, thirst,
    yellowish stool, urine and eyes, and confusion - these symptoms are
    found in fever generated by bile.
    
    \item[33A]  Immobility, fixed, strong attack, sloth, debility, sweetness in the
    mouth, whitish urine and excrement, stultifying, and now disgust as
    well.\footnote{
        This verse is not in the vulgate edition, but the commentator Ḍalhaṇa
        acknowledges it.
    }
    
    % Tuesday, Nov 1
    
    \item[33ab]  Heaviness, cold, becoming moist, the bristling of the hair of the
    body, and excessive sleepiness.
    
   \item[33cd]  
    
   \item[34ab]  
    
    \item[34cd]  Rheum, loss of appetite, cough, and whiteness of the eyes. 
These
    symptoms are found in fever generated by phlegm.
    
   \item[35]  
    
   \item[36]  
    
   \item[37]  
    
   \item[38ab]  
    
    \item[38cd]  All the symptom is generated from all three humors, and, now,
    listen to me about the specific type.
    
    \item[39ab]  Not too hot or cold, minimal consciousness, confused looks, loss
    of voice.
    
   \item[39cd]  
    
    % Wednesday, Nov 2
    
   \item[40ab]  
    
    \item[40cd]  The patient lies down, breathing heavily, affected by babbling as
    complications.
    
    \item[41]  Others call it abhinyāsa(I am not so sure about 
    it.)\footnote{The commentator Ḍalhaṇa discusses it in detail.}, similar to 
Hatauja 
    (not so sure about it) \footnote{The commentator Ḍalhaṇa discusses it in 
detail.}. 
    The fever arising from congested humors is curable with
    difficulty; others find the fever incurable. (I am not too sure about
    the translation, I think I should rework on it.)
    
   \item[42]  
    
   \item[43]  
    
   \item[44]  
    
   \item[45ab]  
    
    \item[45cd--46ab]  (Fever caused by congested humors) becoming more 
severe, it
    attains calmness or kills the patient on the seventh, tenth, or twelfth
    day.
    
    % Thursday, Nov 3
    
    \item[46cd]  Fever arisen by two humors combined is taught of three types
    having symptoms of aggravation of the two concerned humors.
    
    \item[47--48ab]  Thirst, fainting, confusion, burning sensation, loss of sleep,
    headache, dryness of the throat and mouth, nausea, the bristling of the
    hair of the body, and complete loss of appetite, severe joint pain and
    yawning are the features of fever generated by wind and bile.
    
    % Friday, Nov 4
    
    \item[48cd--49]  Numbness, soothing pain in joints, sleepiness, heaviness, in
    the same manner, it arises head-seizure, rheum, cough, sweating. And
    lassitude, delirium, and babbling are the features of fever generated by
    phlegm and wind.
    
    \item[50]  Smeared bitterness in the mouth, drowsiness, lassitude, delirium,
    cough, thirst, recurrent burning feeling, and frequent cold are the
    features of fever generated by phlegm and bile.
    
    % Saturday, Nov 5
    
   \item[51]  
    
   \item[52]  
    
   \item[53]  
    
   \item[54]  
    
   \item[55]  
    
   \item[56]  
    
    \item[57]  Experts say that the fever that occurs every third or fourth cycle
    (malaria in the modern sense!) is generated due to the wind.  And the
    experts say it springs up overheating and overdrinking (pāna? not too
    sure) because of the excessive bile.
    
    \item[58]  Experts say that a slow fever (Monier-Williams gives this) and a
    yellow spot in the white of the eye are caused by the abundance of
    phlegm. The chronic fevers (viṣamajvarā) that are connected...
    (muktānubandhām- not so sure about it, it either could be mutvānubandhām
    or muñcānubandhāṃ, need to check KL 699 ms). They are generally
    generated by two humors jointly. (I should rework on it).
    
    \item[59]  In fever, when phlegm and wind are situated in the skin, they
    initially generate coldness, and they pacify; bile causes a burning
    feeling at the end.
    
    % Sunday, Nov 6
    
    \item[60]  And then, in the beginning, the bile situated in the skin causes a
    burning feeling... (the last part of the pāda is unclear to me, I would
    like to see the reading of K if it is available!) and the other two,
    wind and phlegm, cause cold at the end when it pacifies.
    
    \item[61]  These two fevers, such as burning feeling and cold, are mentioned 
to
    be generated by two humors jointly. Of them, that began with the burning
    feeling is grievous and regarded as the most difficult to cure.
    
    % Monday, Nov 7
    
   \item[62ab]  
    
    \item[62cd--63ab]  As mentioned before, the intermittent fever arising from 
the
    wind forcibly approaches one's own time (svaṃ kālaṃ, not too sure about
    it), in six divisions of day and night. (I should rework on it)
    
    \item[63cd--64]  And the intermittent fever never releases the body since the
    patient does not get relief from heaviness, change of 
    color\footnote{
        H reads gauravavaivarṇyaṃ kārśyebhyo (I am not sure about the 
grammar)
    }, and emaciation. Still, when the sudden attack passes
    away, it is experienced that it is gone.
    
    % Tuesday, Nov 8
    
    \item[65]  When there is little humor, the weak fever ... (not so sure about
    this, also could not get the meaning of 3\textsuperscript{rd} and
    4\textsuperscript{th} pādas, ipānalaḥ, ipa+analaḥ, what would be ipa?
    The vulgate reads iva, I should rework it)
    
    \item[66]  The little humor, produced by the use of unwholesome things,
    generates irregular fever after being located in one of the humors. (the
    2\textsuperscript{nd} pāda is not clear to me. I should rework it.)
    
    % Wednesday, Nov 9
    
    \item[67--68ab]  The humor located constantly in chyle and blood generates 
the
    chronic fever that occurs the other day, based on flesh, produces fever
    that occurs every day, that in fat produces every third day. The same
    located in bone and marrow generates the fever that occurs every four
    days, a very vehement and deadly hybrid of diseases.
    
   \item[68cd]  
    
    \item[69]  The fever is said to be continuous (santata) and continues without 
a
    break for seven, ten, or twelve days.
    
    % Thursday, Nov 10
    
    \item[70--71ab]  In a continuous (satata), there is a two times temperature 
rise
    in a day and night; on other days (anyedyuṣka); however, there is a
    one-time temperature rise in a day and night; In thrice (tṛtīyaka), the
    fever occurs on the third day, and in the case of the fourth, the fever
    occurs on the fourth day.
    
    \item[71cd]  Some say that it is an irregular fever caused by the possession 
of
    demons.
    
   \item[72]  
    
   \item[73]  
    
   \item[74]  
    
   \item[75ab]  
    
    \item[75cd--76ab]  The fever which generates from different types of injuries
    should be considered according to the humors aggravated.
    
    % Friday, Nov 11
    
    \item[76cd--78ab]  The symptoms of fever generated by poison are- a black 
face,
    then diarrhea, and then loss of appetite, thirst, sting, with fainting.
    The symptoms of fever generated by the smell of herbs are- fainting,
    \ldots{} (the text is unclear to me in H). The symptoms of fever, caused
    by pleasure (lust?), are loss of consciousness, lassitude, debility, and
    loss of appetite.
    
   \item[78cd]  
    
    \item[79]  The symptoms of fever generated from fear and grief are babbling,
    and from anger there, arises trembling. From curses and magical spells
    arise delirium and thirst.
    
    % Saturday, Nov 12
    
    \item[80--81ab]  The symptoms of fever generated by the possession of 
demons are
    agitation, laughter, tears, and trembling. Exertion, depletion, and
    inflection of injury aggravate wind.  The wind permeates the whole body
    and causes a severe fever.
    
    \item[81cd--82]  Moreover, from the rise of diseases, inflammation, 
indigestion,
    and another type of fever produced by the same or different causes. I
    shall describe the forms of it according to the order.
    
    % Sunday, Nov 13
    
    \item[83]  The symptoms of fever located in the chyle? (rasa) are heaviness,
    heart pain, exhaustion, vomiting, and appetite loss.
    
    \item[84]  The symptoms of fever in blood acquired from people are
    blood-spitting, burning feelings, delirium, vomiting, confusion,
    babbling, boils, and thirst.
    
    \item[85]  Cramp in the back of the leg, thirst, discharge of urine and stool,
    internal heat, burning feelings,... (vikṣepa) and fatigue of the body
    are the symptoms of fever that occurs in the flesh.
    
    % Monday, Nov 14
    
    \item[86]  The symptoms of fever that occurs in fat are excessive sweating,
    thirst, fainting, babbling, vomiting, bad smell, loss of appetite,
    fatigue, and intolerance.
    
    \item[87]  The symptoms of fever that occurs in bones are ... (bhedontra? not
    clear to me), rumbling of the bowels, wheezing, purging, vomiting, and
    deflection of the limbs.
    
    % Tuesday, Nov 15
    
   \item[88--89ab]  The symptoms of fever that occurs in the marrow are feeling 
of
    darkness, hiccups, cough, cold, vomiting, thirst, internal burning
    feelings, difficulties in breathing\q{a kind of asthma?}, and cutting
    pain in lethal points of the body. In fever occurring in semen, one can
    get death after that.\q{Not happy with the last part.} Stiffness of the
    male organ (penis) and the release of semen excellently lead to 
    death.\q{connecting with the previous pāda?}
    
    \item[89cd--90ab]  As fire is extinguished after burning fuel, and poison
    subsides after beating body tissues. After killing the patient, the
    fever ceases as if it had attained its object.
    
    \item[90cd--91ab]  As the symptoms of fevers are caused by wind, bile, and
    phlegm, the physician should tell about them; the wise should even talk
    in the case of chyle, etc.
    
    % Wednesday, Nov 16
    
    \item[91cd--92ab]  The symptoms of fevers that are even stated in body 
tissue
    should be specified as caused by all congested humors. And that
    generated by two humors combined should be reported by the symptoms of
    the involvement of two humors.
    
    \item[92cd--93ab]  And severe fever should be understood to be caused by
    internal burning feelings, thirst, suppression of urine and stools,...
    \q{(atyartha? excessive?)}, and by the growing of wheezing and cough.
    
    \item[93cd--94ab]  The fever patient who has lost splendor and sense, has
    weakness and loss of appetite, and is afflicted with severe, sharp, and
    vehemence sickness should be given up.
    
    % Thursday, Nov 17
    
    \item[94cd--95ab]  The vigor of fever over the period of three, seven, and
    twelve days...\q{for...dvādaśādikaḥ)? not clear to me, is it
    dvādaśādhikaḥ?} should become intense by the arising of the humors that
    are inferior, moderate, and superior\q{(any better medical terms for
    them?)}. That fever is easily curable in a successive manner.
    
   \item[95cd--96ab]  
    
    \item[96cd]  Thus the kinds of fevers are described and, now the treatment 
will
    be explained.
    
    \item[97]  Now, the wise (the physician) should make the patient drunk with 
the
    clarified butter in the prodrome of fever, then overspreading the
    clarified butter, and easiness will be achieved by the patient. (not so
    happy with the translation)
    
    \item[98]  The prescribed action is just for fever generated by wind; in the
    case of fever generated by the bile, mild purge, and in phlegm-generated
    fever and two humors combined, vomiting is prescribed.  (here,
    dvandvakaphajeṣu is not clear to me)
    
    % Friday, Nov 18
    
   \item[99]  
    
    \item[100]  One should know the variety of the former forms (prākrūpirūpa, 
any
    better word?) like the fire of smoke, and fasting is wholesome by all
    means in the case of fever that is fully manifested forms.
    
    \item[101cd--102ab]  As long as the patient is bound with fasting, he is
    distressed with immobile humors. So long he should rely on a light diet
    as if he was purged.
    
    \item[102cd--103ab]  Fasting should not be done in the period of fever 
generated
    by the wind, depletion, and of psychic origin and even in those
    mentioned as unfit for fasting earlier in the chapter on treating
    twofold wounds. (Ci.Ch. 1).
    
    % Saturday, Nov 19
    
    \footnote{Not in vulgate.}
    
    \item[104A]  When the wind blows, the patient feels hungry and thirsty, he is
    accompanied by confusion, and his mouth dries up. When the morbid
    swellings have just arisen, and the wounds have become severe, even in
    the case of feebleness, the child, the old, and the pregnant should not
    work. (I should rework this.)
    
    \item[103cd--104ab]  Fasting in the sick person with unsteady humor and
    digestive fire digests humors, destroys fever and ingestion and becomes
    instrumental in producing appetite, taste, and lightness.
    
    \item[104cd--105ab]  One should know the patient who properly fasted 
caused the
    discharge of wind, flatulence, and urine, is intolerant to hunger and
    thirst, ...\q{(since the word lagha is not clear to me)}, cheerful with
    their senses, and debilitated.\q{(Not too happy with it.)}
    
    % Sunday, Nov 20
    
    \item[105cd--106ab]  Excessive fasting generates depletion of strength, 
thirst,
    fainting, lassitude, sleepiness, confusion, fatigue, side effects,
    wheezing, etc.
    
    \item[106cd--108ab]  The hot water ingests, destroys phlegm, and takes ...
    (varccā?) and bile in their regular order. It is wholesome for thirst
    and those suffering from fever generated from phlegm and wind.. Then,
    indeed, it softens humors and tubes. The cold water does the opposite.
    After that, by being consumed by cold water, the fever increases. (I
    should rework it)
    
    \item[108cd]  In fevers generated by bile, alcohol, and poison, cold water
    boiled with tiktaka (I could not get whether it is bitters or any recipe
    like Agathotes Chirayta or a kind of Khadira or other since the second
    hemistich is not in H), should be applied.
    
    % Monday, Nov 21
    
   \item[109ab]  
    
    \item[109cd--110ab]  Of those patients suffering from fever, rice gruel or any
    drink mixed with a small quantity of boiled rice prepared according to
    its digestive is wholesome in a decent hour for eating since it is
    indigestion, digestive, and light.
    
   \item[110cd]  
    
    \item[111--112ab]  When the humor is not digested by fasting, water and 
gruel,
    then the patient should be treated with a decoction that is digestive,
    cordial, and febrifuge, which removes bad taste in the mouth, thirst,
    and appetite-loss and the decoction.
    
    \item[112cd--113]  The decoction of five roots (pañcamūlī) should be used as 
a
    digestive in fever generated by wind.  In the fever generated by bile,
    the decoction should be made of nutgrass, sharp root (kaṭukā), and
    tellicherry bark (indrayava) \q{(not sure about it)} with honey, while in
    phlegm-generated fever, the decoction of longer pepper and others,
    should be used as digestive.
    
    % Tuesday, Nov 22
    
    \q{(Not in vulgate)}
    
    \item[113A]  When the humors are gathered together, then the combined 
digestive
    is wholesome.\q{(I am looking for a better translation)}
    
   \item[114]  
    
    \item[115--116ab]  In fever, the humor should be understood as ripened 
when the
    fever is moderate, body is light and movement in waste products, then
    the drug should be given.
    
    The characteristic of the ripened one is due to the alteration of the
    natural disposition of the humors.
    
   \item[116cd]  
    
   \item[117]  
    
   \item[118]  
    
   \item[119ab]  
    
    \item[119cd--120ab]  Some people think that the medicine should be given 
after
    seven nights. Some people feel confident that the medication is worth
    giving after ten nights.
    
    \item[120cd--121ab]  Or, in the bile-generated fever that has arisen for a 
short
    time, medicine is given. And the medicine should be given even to a
    feverish person with a very long fever when the humor is ripened.
    
    % Wednesday, Nov 23

    part of the body and has splendid digestive fire.
    
    \item[129]  The weak and little humor patient should be treated with

    small-root radish and the soup of neem and black pepper (kolaka),\q{not so

    (143 \& 144cd) In that case, a mixture of black pepper, long pepper, and

    appetite loss. A person (patient) suffering from a chronic fever and

    \item[145--146ab]  However, drinking milk kills a human being (patient) 
when he

    Otherwise, it increases the shock of fever.
    
    \item[146cd--147ab]  When the patient has a fever, he should eat
